            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head type="sub">Now Publiſhed For the Juſtification of all thoſe Loyal Perſons, who oppoſed the Petition in any parts of the Nation.</head>
            <p>IF it be the undoubted Prerogative of the King to Call, Adjourn, Prorogue, and Diſſolve Parliaments at his Will and Pleaſure; it is a high Impudence in any Subject, or Aſſembly of men, to take upon them to Adviſe him (unasked) how and when to execute his Power: for it concludes, that the Adviſers or Petitioners do believe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64388:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->that he is either ſo weak, as not to be able to judge when and how it is fit for him to do it; or ſo ill a King, that he will not do it, when he knows 'tis for the Advantage of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Kingdom; and is in plain terms to ſay, the King is either a Fool or a Knave: which if not High-Treaſon, I am ſure is a violation of Duty, and a breach of good Manners. But to go on with ſuch an Adviſing Petition, when his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Proclamation does forbid any thing of this nature, is a moſt ſuperlative Inſolence: Nor can all the formal words u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſuch Addreſſes, of <hi>Humble, Dutiful,</hi> and <hi>Loyal,</hi> palliate for this Wheedle, or make other conſtruction, than that his loving, humble, and dutiful Subjects do with all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty beſeech him to permit them to ſhare with him in the moſt important Truſt, and moſt eminent Mark of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty that God Almighty hath endowed him with.</p>
            <p>Should the King, by any manner of Application, and with all the terms of Kindneſs that words can expreſs, ſend a gratious Meſſage to the Parliament, wherein he ſhould adviſe them to part with any (though never ſo ſmall a Priviledge) they would reſent it to a ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And is not the Prerogative as dear to the King, as Priviledge to the Parliament?</p>
            <p>Let no Sophiſter ſay, that the Proclamation is not meant to intend this way of Petitioning, by alleadging, that it is the onely <hi>lawful Means and Entercourſe 'twixt the King and his People.</hi> 'Tis certain he meant this very way of Petitioning; for till there was a previous Addreſs from the Lords, and Endeavours to get Hands to ſuch Petitions, there was nothing heard of a Proclamation: which when it appeared, did fully denote this very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Petitioning, <hi>ſo fatal to his Father,</hi> and this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and ought by all Loyal Gentlement to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of as ſuch.</p>
            <p>I confeſs it is one of the worſt things imaginable, to remember Injuries; but it is as unpardonable a folly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64388:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->to forget the Rock we have once ſhipwracked on, and not to avoid it, when it is fully in our power ſo to do. 'Tis therefore highly worth our note, what ſort of men they are who firſt ſet this Buſineſs on foot; not to reflect on any things they have done, but onely to avoid being led into a ſecond Miſchief.</p>
            <p>Of the ſeventeen Lords, by whoſe order and in whoſe name the Addreſs was preſented to the King, there is not one who either in <hi>himſelf or his Father, can lay a claim to any honourable Service performed either to this King or his Father, during the time of the late Rebellion;</hi> but on the contrary, I finde ſeveral of their <hi>Names ſubſcribed to the Covenant;</hi> and have heard of moſt of the reſt under the names of <hi>Generals of Horſe, Colonels and Commanders in the late Rebellious Armies, or conſtant Sitters in the Rump, Committee of Safety, and all Junctoes against the King.</hi> And if the late Wars were begun with Petitions, and by theſe very men and their Fathers, it cannot but be adviſable by all Loyal Gentlemen what may be the end of their Petitions: And whether they are ſet on foot for the Publick Good by private men, or for private Ends with the name of the Publick.</p>
            <p>An Enquiry were worth the while,<note n="*" place="margin">Whereof ſome were old Officers, and others Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-men and Sequeſtrators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> who they are that promote their Petitions in other Countries, and obſerve by whom their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are addreſſed from above to ours, or who are the men that are moſt active in the proſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; I am afraid we ſhall finde as few Loyal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the Country to better themſelves, as we have found Lords at <hi>London:</hi> And if any old Royaliſts appear, we ſhall finde them either ſuch as are concerned in the late <hi>unheard-of Vote about the Succeſſion,</hi> or ſuch as are grown waſpiſh that they are not better preferred for ſervices by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, and hope to repair broken Fortunes by a publick Ruine.</p>

            <!-- PDF PAGE 50 -->
            <p>Since then this Undertaking is to <hi>Invade the Crown, Affront the Perſon of the King, warranted by no Preſident but ſuch as begot Rebellion, nor led by any body of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent note for Loyalty,</hi> but rather on the contrary, <hi>expreſly forbidden by the King;</hi> (which is ſufficient warning it ſelf, were there no other apprehenſions of evil intentions;) it will become all perſons who abhor Sedition, and have an honour for the Royal Name, to obey the King's Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; the onely way to ſecure the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and their own.</p>
